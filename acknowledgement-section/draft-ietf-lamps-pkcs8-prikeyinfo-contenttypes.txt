1.  Introduction

   The syntax for private-key information was originally described in
   [RFC5208] and later obsoleted by [RFC5958].  This document defines
   PKCS #8 content types for use with PrivateKeyInfo and
   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Private-Key Information Content Types

   This section defines a content type for private-key information and
   encrypted private-key information.

   The PrivateKeyInfo content type is identified by the following object
   identifier:

   id-ct-privateKeyInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
    smime(16) ct(1) TBD1 }

   The EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo content type is identified by the
   following object identifier:

   id-ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
    smime(16) ct(1) TBD2 }

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC5958] apply here.

5.  IANA Considerations

   For the private key info content types defined in section Section 3,
   IANA is requested to assign an object identifier (OID) for each of
   the content types.  The OIDs for the content types should be
   alloacted in the "SMI Security for S/MIME CMS Content Type" registry
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1), and the description should be set to id-
   ct-privateKeyInfo (TDB1) and id-ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo (TBD2).

   For the ASN.1 Module in Section 6, IANA is requested to assign an
   object identifier (OID) for the module identifier.  The OID for the
   module should be allocated in the "SMI Security for S/MIME Module
   Identifier" registry (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.0), and the Description
   for the new OID should be set to "id-mod-pkcs8ContentType".

6.  ASN.1 Module
