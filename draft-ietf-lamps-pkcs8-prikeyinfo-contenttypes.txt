1.  Introduction

   The syntax for private-key information was originally described in
   [RFC5208], and the syntax was later revised by [RFC5958] to include
   the AsymmetricKeyPackage content type that supports multiple
   PrivateKeyInfos.  This document defines PKCS #8 content types for use
   with one PrivateKeyInfo and EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo.  These content
   type assignments are needed for PrivateKeyInfo and
   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo to be carried in the Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS) [RFC5652].

   Note: A very long time ago, media types for PrivateKeyInfo and
   EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo were assigned as application/pkcs8 and
   application/pkcs8-encrypted, respectively.

2.  Private-Key Information Content Types

   This section defines a content type for private-key information and
   encrypted private-key information.

   The PrivateKeyInfo content type is identified by the following object
   identifier:

   id-ct-privateKeyInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
    smime(16) ct(1) TBD1 }

   The EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo content type is identified by the
   following object identifier:

   id-ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
    smime(16) ct(1) TBD2 }

3.  ASN.1 Module

   The ASN.1 module [X680][X690] in this section builds upon the modules
   in [RFC5911].

   <CODE BEGINS>
   PrivateKeyInfoContentTypes
    { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
      pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-pkcs8ContentType(TBD0) }

   DEFINITIONS IMPLICIT TAGS ::=
   BEGIN

   -- EXPORTS ALL

   IMPORTS

   CONTENT-TYPE
    FROM CryptographicMessageSyntax-2009 -- in [RFC5911]
      { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
        pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0) id-mod-cms-2004-02(41) }

   PrivateKeyInfo, EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
    FROM AsymmetricKeyPackageModuleV1 -- in [RFC5958]
       { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1)
         pkcs-9(9) smime(16) modules(0)
         id-mod-asymmetricKeyPkgV1(50) }  ;


   PrivateKeyInfoContentTypes CONTENT-TYPE ::= {
    ct-privateKeyInfo | ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo,
    ... -- Expect additional content types --  }

   ct-privateKeyInfo CONTENT-TYPE ::= { PrivateKeyInfo
    IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-privateKeyInfo }

   id-ct-privateKeyInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
    smime(16) ct(1) TBD1 }

   ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo CONTENT-TYPE ::= { EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo
    IDENTIFIED BY id-ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo }

   id-ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1)
    member-body(2) us(840) rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
    smime(16) ct(1) TBD2 }

   END
   <CODE ENDS>

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations in [RFC5958] apply here.

5.  IANA Considerations

   For the private key info content types defined in section Section 2,
   IANA is requested to assign an object identifier (OID) for each of
   the content types.  The OIDs for the content types should be
   alloacted in the "SMI Security for S/MIME CMS Content Type" registry
   (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.1) [IANA-CMS-CTS], and the description should
   be set to id-ct-privateKeyInfo (TDB1) and id-ct-encrPrivateKeyInfo
   (TBD2).

   For the ASN.1 Module in Section 3, IANA is requested to assign an
   object identifier (OID) for the module identifier.  The OID for the
   module should be allocated in the "SMI Security for S/MIME Module
   Identifier" registry (1.2.840.113549.1.9.16.0) [IANA-SMIME-MODS], and
   the Description for the new OID should be set to "id-mod-
   pkcs8ContentType".

   IANA is also requested to update the application/cms entry in the
   "Media Types" registry to add [ RFC-to-be] to the list of RFCs where
   Inner Content Types (ICTs) are defined in the "Optional parameters"
   and the "Interoperability considerations" sections.

   IANA is also requested to update the application/cms entry in the
   "Media Types" registry to add the following values to the
   "innerContent" list:

   *  privateKeyInfo

   *  encrPrivateKeyInfo

   And, to update the following row in the application/cms entry's
   "Security considerations" section:

      +===============+============================================+
      | RFC           | CMS Protecting Content Type and Algorithms |
      +===============+============================================+
      | [ RFC-to-be ] | privateKeyInfo and encrPrivateKeyInfo      |
      +---------------+--------------------------------------------+
